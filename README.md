## 📖 About

**egg.exe** is a psychological interactive fiction game about cataloging memories. You are an operator processing "eggs" that represent memories, each carrying different emotional weight. Your choices determine not only the ending, but your very capacity to continue processing memories.

Through a retro terminal interface, you'll face 13 eggs across 5 days. Each decision matters:
- **Incubate** memories to keep them
- **Neutralize** them to let go
- **Observe** to understand them better (limited uses)

But be careful—your analysis capacity is limited, and wrong choices can leave you operating blind.

## ✨ Features

- **Branching narrative** with 5 distinct endings
- **Consequence-driven mechanics**: choices affect your gameplay capacity
- **Retro terminal aesthetic** with glitch effects and ASCII art
- **Dynamic soundscape** with reactive audio feedback
- **Capacity management system** that forces strategic thinking
- **Randomized outcomes** based on your emotional balance (light vs shadow)

## 🎨 Endings

The game features multiple endings based on your choices:
- **"Guardião de Memórias" (Memory Guardian)** - Light path
- **"Livre" (Free)** - Secret ending
- **"Mais Um Dia" (One More Day)** - Neutral/Incubate path
- **"Recomeço" (New Beginning)** - Neutral/Neutralize path
- **"O Peso do Silêncio" (The Weight of Silence)** - Dark path

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Engine:** Twine (Harlowe 3.3.9)
- **Audio:** HAL (Harlowe Audio Library v2.3.0)
- **Custom CSS** for terminal/retro aesthetic
- **JavaScript** for flickering effects and UI controls
- **HTML5 Audio** for dynamic sound design

### Game Mechanics:
- **Capacity System:** Start with 6 analysis points, gain/lose based on choices
- **Light/Shadow Balance:** Affects random event outcomes
- **Progressive Difficulty:** System deteriorates from Day 3 onwards
- **Observation Lock:** Can't observe eggs without capacity
